# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a 3rd year mechanical engineering student at the University of Waterloo. While I study mechanical engineering, my curiousity leads me into all engineering fields. I thrive at the intersection of engineering diciplines which is probably why I love robotics so much! I've been a part of the University of Waterloo Robotics team since 2021 and I have been a leader on the team in one form or another since early 2022.
