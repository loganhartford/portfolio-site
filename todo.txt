Trying to break up the project section:

What I've learned
- The collections section in config generates the html for the project pages but I haven't found what generates project/index.html
- to be able to break up the projects, I need to generate my own other_projects/index.html so I can indlude it where I want
- Could also try fully duplicating what is being done for the projects seciton and have a seperate page for the other projects
- This is low priority so for now I will just get all the project content into the website and I can move it around later
