## Mystery
Consider experiments done with split brain patients. That is, patients who have had their corpus callosum severed for one reason or another (usually to treat epilepsy).

If you flash the words "KEY + RING" across the screen, while asking them to fixate on the cross between the words, and then ask them what they saw, they will say ring. Even when asked what kind of ring, they will still say just ring.

If you then blindfold the split brain patient and then bring out a box of random things which includes a key and a ring and a keyring, and ask them to reach in with their left hand and pull out what they say on the screen they will always pull out a key and reject the keyring if they encounter it. If you ask the patient what is in their hand they can't tell you, they guess randomly.

If you now ask them to perform the same task with their right hand, they will always pull out a ring and reject a keyring if they encounter it. If you ask the patient what is in their right hand, they will confidently say ring.

If you remove the blindfold and ask them why they are holding a key and a ring when they said the word they saw was ring, they'll have no idea or they'll concoct a fake story about why they pulled out the key and the ring.

If you ask the patient to draw with their left hand what they saw they will draw a key.

**What's going on here?**
When you ask the patient to focus on the cross between the words, the information about the key only enters the right hemisphere and the information about the key only enters the left. In a normal person, the corpus callosum allows the sides of the brain to exchange information about what they say and you can easily produce "KEYRING".

In the split brain patients, only the left side of the brain has information about a ring and since that is the side of the brain that can talk, they say they only say a ring when prompted. The left hemisphere controls the right hand which is why they pull out a ring when asked to do so with their right hand.

When the patient pulls out the key with their left, they have no idea idea what's in their hand because only the right hemisphere knows whats in their and it can't talk.

This suggests that when split, separate consciousnesses develop in both sides of the brain.
