## The Ideology of competitions
* In 2010 Microsoft and Google with both more valuable than Apple.
* They were caught up in a war, Windows vs Chrome OS, Chrome vs Edge, Bing vs Google search.
* Meanwhile Apple eclipsed them both, war is costly.
* By 2013 Apple was worth more than Microsoft and Google combined.

## Last Move Advantage
* If you company can be described by its oppositions to already existing firms, then it's not completely new and it's probably not going to become a monopoly.

## Follow the Money
* Every single company in a venture portfolio must have the *potential* to succeed at a vast scale.
* Each company must have the potential to become a multi-billion dollar company.

### Don't Start Your Own Company
* Even if you are the most talented person on the planet, too many people are starting their own companies right now.
* You can become tremendously successful by joining the very best company while it's growing fast.
* You will have more of the pie if you start your own company but the pie will likely be much smaller.
* If you could have owned even just 0.01% of Google would be worth $194M as of January 2024.
