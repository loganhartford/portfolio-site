## The Ideology of competitions
* In 2010 Microsoft and Google with both more valuable than Apple.
* They were caught up in a war, Windows vs Chrome OS, Chrome vs Edge, Bing vs Google search.
* Meanwhile Apple eclipsed them both, war is costly.
* By 2013 Apple was worth more than Microsoft and Google combined.

## Last Move Advantage
* If you company can be described by its oppositions to already existing firms, then it's not completely new and it's probably not going to become a monopoly.

## Follow the Money
* Every single company in a venture portfolio must have the *potential* to succeed at a vast scale.
* Each company must have the potential to become a multi-billion dollar company.

### Don't Start Your Own Company
* Even if you are the most talented person on the planet, too many people are starting their own companies right now.
* You can become tremendously successful by joining the very best company while it's growing fast.
* You will have more of the pie if you start your own company but the pie will likely be much smaller.
* If you could have owned even just 0.01% of Google would be worth $194M as of January 2024.

## Foundations
* When considering startups, the technical abilities and complimentary skills of the co-founders matters.
* What is more important though is that the founders work well together.
* They should have a pre-history together before starting a company, otherwise they are just rolling the dice.

### Incentives
* A CEO of a large company like General Motors will own some stock but only a trivial portion.
* Instead focusing on the long term success of the company, he will focus on short term gains to maintain his position.
* Even if he is being rewarded with stock, mis-alignment can still exist since the CEO may find it much more lucrative to focus on cutting costs than investing in the future.
* A cash poor executive by contrast will focus on increasing the value of the company as a whole.
    * In general, a company does better the less it pays its CEO.

## The Mechanics of Mafia
* You'll attract the employees you need if you can explain why you mission is compelling; not why it is important in general.
* You should be able to explain why you company is a unique match for him personally, and if you can't do that then you probably don't have the right match.

## Viral Marketing
* A product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to share it with their friends and they become users too.
* Sometimes paying for ads is not as efficient as directly paying for customer acquisition.
* If you pay $10 for a user to refer a friend and then give the friend $10 as well, you've acquired a new customer for $20.
* If the average lifetime value of the customer exceeds $20 then you have the potential for strong growth with this strategy.

## Seeing Green
You business will fail if it cannot answer one of these seven questions:
1. **The Engineering Question**
    * Can you create a breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements.
2. **The Timing Question**
    * Is not the right time to start you particular business?
3. **The Monopoly Question**
    * Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
4. **The People Question**
    * Do you have the right team?
5. **The Distribution Question**
    * Do you have a way, not just to create, but to deliver your product?
6. **The Durability Question**
    * Will you market position be defensible in 10 or 20 years?
7. **The Secret Question**
    * Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
