## The Fundamentals

### Goals Restrict Your Happiness
The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: "Once I reach my goal, then I'll be happy." The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you're continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.

A goal is a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you desire.

### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity:
* "I'm terrible with directions."
* "I'm not a morning person."
* "I'm bad at remembering people's names."
* "I'm always late."
* "I'm not good with technology."
* "I'm horrible at math."
When you repeat these stories to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as fact.

You can break these negative assumptions about yourself through habits. For example: if you think you are not a writer, but would like to be, make a habit of writing every day.

Changing your identity is a two step process:
1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Ask yourself, "Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?" 
"Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?"

Breaking habits:

4. Make it unsatisfying.

## The 1st Law: Make It Obvious

### The Diderot Effect
Obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.

### Habit Stacking
One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top of it.
> "After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

### Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
If possible, have a single room or environment for each important use in you life like sleep, work and relaxation.

If you can't get and entirely new environment, create a space for work, study, excercise, entertainment, and cooking.

> "One space, one use."

I can be difficult to go to bed early if you watch TV in you bedroom each night an it can be hard to study in the living room if thats where you always play video games.

### The Secret To Self-Control
Make the cue of your good habits obvious and the cues of you bad habits invisible.

## The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

### Temptation Bundling
Bundle the habits you want to create with things you already enjoy doing.
* Only watch you favorite show on the treadmill.

### Habit Stacking + Temptation Bundling
1. After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
2. After I [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

**Example:**
1. After I brush my teeth, I will stretch for 5 minutes.
2. After I stretch for 5 minutes, I will check instagram.

### Reprogramming
Change your internal dialogue. You don't "have to" you "get to."

You get to wake up early for work, you get to make another sales call for your business, you get to cook dinner for you family.

Be empowered by your good choices
