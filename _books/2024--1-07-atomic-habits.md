## The Fundamentals
### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

#### Goals Restrict Your Happiness
The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: "Once I reach my goal, then I'll be happy." The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you're continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.

A goal is a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you desire.

### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity:
* "I'm terrible with directions."
* "I'm not a morning person."
* "I'm bad at remembering people's names."
* "I'm always late."
* "I'm not good with technology."
* "I'm horrible at math."
When you repeat these stories to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as fact.

You can break these negative assumptions about yourself through habits. For example: if you think you are not a writer, but would like to be, make a habit of writing every day.

Changing your identity is a two step process:
1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Ask yourself, "Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?" 
"Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?"
