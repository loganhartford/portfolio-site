## Part I : Mind

### Become Present
Presence is rare these days. Those who are able to be fully present with the person in front of them, giving them all their energy and attention, will leave a lasting impression on them.

> *"People don't understand that the hardest thing is actually doing something that is close to nothing. It demands all of you...there is no object to hide behind. It's just you." -Marina AbramoviÄ‡*

We want to learn to see the world as an artist. While others are oblivious to what surrounds them, the artist really sees. All they are thinking about is how to capture and communicate this experience.

Don't reject a difficult or boring moment because it is not exactly what you want. Don't waste a beautiful moment because you are insecure or shy. Make what you can of what you have been given. Live what can be lived. That's what excellence is. That's what presence makes possible.

### Limit Your Inputs
The way you feel when you wake up in the morning and you mind is fresh and yet unsoiled by the noise of the outside world--that space is worth protecting. So too is the zone you lock into when you are working really well.

### Slow Down, Think Deeply
On a regular basis, you should think about:
* What's important to you.
* What's actually going on .
* What might be hidden from view.
* What the rest of the chessboard might look like.
* What the meaning of life really is.

>*"Sit along in a room and let your thoughts go wherever they will. Do this for one minute... Work up to ten minutes a day of this mindless mental wandering. Then start paying attention to your thoughts to see if a work or a goal materializes. If it doesn't, extend the exercise to eleven minutes, then twelve, then thirteen...until you find the length of time you need to ensure that something interesting will come to mind. The Gaelic phrase for this state of mind 'quietness without loneliness." -Twyla Tharp*

### Seek Wisdom
>*"All I know is that I know nothing." -Socrates*

Read and read deeply.
>*"I cannot understand how some people can live without ever communicating with the wisest people who ever lived on earth." -Tolstoy*

Never stop learning.
>*"Learning must never cease...The noble person who studies widely and examines himself each day will become clear in his knowing and faultless in his conduct." -Xunzi*

### Find Confidence, Avoid Ego
Confidence is the freedom to set your own standards and unshackle yourself from the need to prove yourself. A confident person doesn't fear disagreement and doesn't see an admission of incorrectness as and admission of inferiority.

## Part II: Sprit

### The Domain of the Soul
We are incapable of see what is essential in the world if we are blind to what's going on inside us.
>*"What am I doing with my soul? Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so called mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child's soul? An Adolescent's?...A tyrant's soul? The soul of a predator--or its prey?" -Marcus Aurelius*

### Choose Virtue
Each of us must cultivate a moral code, a higher standard that we love more than life itself. Each of us must sit down and ask: *What's important to me? What would I rather die than betray? How am I going to live and why?*
