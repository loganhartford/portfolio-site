## Biology and History
1. Life is competition.
    * We cooperate in out group--out family, community, club, curch, party, "race", or nation--in order to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups.
2. Life is selection.
    * If we knew our fellow men throoughly we could select thirty percent of them whose combined ability would equal all the rest.
    * Only the man who is below the average in economic ability desires equality; those who are conscious of superior ability desire freedom; and in the end superior ability has its way.

## Morals and History
* Pugnacity, brutality, greed and sexual readiness were advantages in the struggle for existence. Probably every vice was once a virtue.
* Morals from agriculture:
    * Children were economic assets, birth control was made immoral. 
    * On the farm the family was the unit of production under the discipline of the father and the seasons, and paternal authority had a firm economic base. 
    * Each normal son matured soon in mind and self-support; as fifteen he understood the phsyical tasks of life as well as he would understand them at forty; all that he needed was lant, a plaow and a willing arm. 
    * So he married early, almost as soon as nature wished; he did not fret long under the restraints placed upon premarital restrictino by the new order of permanent settlements and homes.

## Religion and History
* There is no significant example in history, before our time, of a society successfullyl maintaininy moral life without the aid of religion.

## Economics and History
* Concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically aleviated by violent or peaceable partioal redistribution. 
* In this view all economic history is the slow hearbeat od the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation.
