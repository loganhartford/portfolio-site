## Learning Machine Learning
* Learn the absolute minimum you need before starting [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
* Start working through the course.

### How to Fast.AI
1. Start with the video lesson.
2. Then head to the book chapter and run the code in the notebook.
    * Focus on understanding what's going on in each cell.
3. Try and recreate the pipeline from  the notebook or video.
    * You can refer back for help but try to do this using your notes, documentation and whatever else.
4. Apply what you have learned to a new dataset.

## Becoming a Developer
Make use of long, uninterrupted work sessions.
* Put away your phone.
* Clear your browser tabs.
* Move to a productive workspace.

### Flow
Good developers spend a lot of time studying their editors and swear by the ones that don't require you to lift a finger. When you reach for you mouse your flow is interrupted.

## How to Learn
Make your learning active.
* Take notes when you watch the videos or read the note books.
* Review you notes.
* Focus on practical application of what you are learning.
* Create mini-projects that you can share with the world.

## The Hidden Game of ML
The hidden game is the ability to generalize to unseen data.
* [How (and why) to create a good validation set.](https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/)
* [Learning From Data: A Short Course.](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Data-Yaser-S-Abu-Mostafa/dp/1600490069)
* [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)
* [How to deploy.](https://youtu.be/5L3Ao5KuCC4)
* [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Machine-Learning-Powered-Applications/dp/149204511X)

## How to Structure a Machine Learning Project
1. Create a good train-validation split.
2. Create a baseline.
    * The simplest transformation of the training data that will move the needle on the metric measured by the validation set.
    * Helps to better understand the problem.
    * Helps remove bugs from the pipeline.
3. Next, work on the part of the pipeline that will benefit most from tweaking.
4. Invest time early in exploring a larger set of architectures and developing diagnostic code.
5. Move in small increments.
6. Consider constructing a smaller train set so you can test if you changes are having a positive impact more quickly.

## How to Win at Kaggle
1. Join a competition early.
2. Read the forums daily.
3. Make small improvements every day.
4. Find a validation split that tracks the leader boards.
5. Posts from top Kagglers will get you 80% of the way.
6. Use research papers, blog posts and creativity for the last 20%.
7. Ensemble results.


## Side Notes
* Learn to use your code editor really well.
