## The Truth About Relativity - The Decoy Effect
The relative value of different options disproportionately impacts our decision making.

Say you were deciding between a trip to Rome and a trip to Paris. The decision would not be easy. However, if you were deciding between a trip to Paris with free breakfast, a trip to Rome without free breakfast and a trip to Rome with free breakfast. Suddenly the trip to Rome with free breakfast seems to be most appealing.

Comparing the options in this way on some level equates Paris with free breakfast on the same playing field as Rome without, therefore, Rome with free breakfast irrationally appears to be the most desirable choice.

Similarly if you are going to an even and want to make the best possible impress bring some who looks like you but it slightly less attractive or slightly less funny. You will seem much more likable than you would on you own.

## The Cost of Social Norms
If you were to ask a group of lawyers if they would offer their services to retirees for $30/hour they would likely say now. Were you to approach the same group and ask if they would do it for free, they would be much more likely to agree.

When out for dinner with a date, never mention that price of the food. While she may not be aware of how much this meal will set you back, mentioning the price will shift the meeting from the realm of social norms to the realm of market norms.

## The Power of a Free Cookie
Charging companies based on their pollution level may not be the best idea. A company may find from cost/benefit analysis that they are better to pollute even more and their will be morally free from guilt since they are paying for the pollution. A better way to curb pollution would be to tie it to their products. Force them to include it like we include nutrition facts on food.

## Influence of Arousal
People are completely unable to predict how their behavior and feelings will changed when aroused. They will insist they act a certain way when in a cold rational state and completely underestimate their reactions when aroused.

One study found that a teenage driving alone was 40% more likely than an adult to get into a car accident. If there was another teenager in that car the number doubled and if there was a third teenage in the car the chance doubled again.

## The Problem with Procrastination and Self Control

**A good business idea:** Self-Control Credit Card
A credit card that will send you alerts when you are getting close or have gone over the spending limits you set for different item categories.

## The High Price of Ownership
People tend to over value things they already own.

In one study, Duke students who didn't have ticket to the championship basketball game said they would be willing to pay $170 for a ticket. Whereas the student who already did have a ticket said they would not let it go for less than $2400.

The people with the tickets have already envisioned themselves at the game and the memories it will create and are therefore irrationally pricing the tickets.

This effect is why the 30-day money back guarantee works so well. Even if you are not fully satisfied with the product after 30 days. After 30 days you value the product more than its worth so getting the money back for it seems less appealing.

## The Effect of Expectations
When something has high expectations, reality is likely to fall short of expectation and leave us feeling disappointed by the experience, even if it was objectively good.

If you go to a nice restaurant that your friends has been telling you for weeks is the best place she's ever eaten, you are less likely to enjoy the meal then if you just showed up without context.

This also why the most over-hyped movies never seem to quite hit the spot when you see them in theaters.

### Sterotypes
The effect of expectation comes into play with stereotypes and what we believe about ourselves. There are sterotypes which say that Asians are good at math and women are bad. When Asian women were asked math questions, they performed better if they were asked a question about their race before than if they were asked a question about their gender.

In another study, elderly people were timed as they walked down a hall. In the first case, they did not recieve any primers, in the second, they were primed with words like "bingo" and "ancient". The group that was primed walked down the halway more slowly.

## The Power of Price
Students at the University of Iowa who purchase medication on sale had reported worse health outcomes than those who purchased them full prices. In another experiement, studnet who payed full price for a sprots drink were less fatigued after their workouts that those who payed a reduced price.

## The Cycle of Distrust
Poeple are naturally distrustful of advertisements now. Participants rated a stero system much more highly and said they would pay more money for it if they read about the stero in a 3rd party brochure than if they had read about it in a brouchure produced by the store. The contents of the brochure were identical but the power of an un-biased opinion was at play.
