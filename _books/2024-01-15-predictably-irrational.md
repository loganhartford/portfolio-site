## The Truth About Relativity - The Decoy Effect
- **Relative Value**: The relative value of different options disproportionately impacts our decision making.
- **Example**: Deciding between a trip to **Rome** and **Paris**. Add options: Paris with free breakfast, Rome without free breakfast, and Rome with free breakfast. Rome with free breakfast becomes most appealing.
- **Insight**: Comparing options this way irrationally makes Rome with free breakfast the most desirable choice.

## The Cost of Social Norms
- **Lawyers' Response**: Ask lawyers to work for retirees at $30/hour, they say no. Ask if they'd do it for free, they're more likely to agree.
- **Dinner Date**: Never mention the price of the meal to avoid shifting from **social norms** to **market norms**.

## The Power of a Free Cookie
- **Pollution Control**: Charging companies based on pollution level might backfire. Instead, tie pollution levels to products, like **nutrition facts** on food.

## Influence of Arousal
- **Behavior Prediction**: People can't predict how arousal changes their behavior.
- **Driving Study**: Teenage driver alone has a 40% higher accident risk than an adult. Risk doubles with each additional teen in the car.

## The Problem with Procrastination and Self Control
- **Business Idea**: **Self-Control Credit Card** - alerts you when nearing or exceeding spending limits for different categories.

## The High Price of Ownership
- **Valuation Bias**: People overvalue what they own.
- **Study Example**: Duke students with basketball game tickets wouldn't sell for less than $2400, while those without tickets would pay only $170.
- **30-Day Guarantee**: People value a product more after 30 days, making money-back guarantees less appealing.

## The Effect of Expectations
- **Expectations vs. Reality**: High expectations can lead to disappointment.
- **Restaurant Scenario**: A hyped restaurant is less enjoyable than one with no prior expectations.
- **Movie Experience**: Over-hyped movies often disappoint in theaters.

### Stereotypes
- **Impact of Stereotypes**: Stereotypes affect performance based on the priming of identity.
- **Study on Asian Women**: Better performance in math when primed with race rather than gender.
- **Elderly Study**: Primed with age-related words, elderly people walked more slowly.

## The Power of Price
- **Perceived Value**: Medication purchased at full price resulted in better reported health outcomes than those bought on sale.
- **Sports Drink Experiment**: Full-price buyers felt less fatigued than those who paid a reduced price.

## The Cycle of Distrust
- **Advertisement Skepticism**: People distrust ads.
- **Stereo System Study**: Higher ratings for stereo systems advertised in a third-party brochure compared to a store-produced brochure.
