## Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back

### Confidence
Lobsters battle for mating rights and in the aftermath of loosing battle, no matter how aggressive it was before, the lobster become unwilling to fight further, even against other losers. The lobsters will sometimes loose confidence for days. In severe cases, the dominant lobsters brain essentially dissolved and it grows a new one more suited to its new subordination.

Anyone who has experienced a painful transformation after a serious defeat in romance or career may be able to empathize with the once successful crustacean.

### Anxiety
It does not matter so much what time you go to bed at but waking up at the same time each morning is very important. Anxiety and depression cannot be easily treated if the sufferer has unpredictable daily routines. The systems that mediate negative emotions are tightly tied to the circadian rhythms. Eat a high fat and protein breakfast after waking.

#### Alcohol
During a hangover, anxiety levels generally increase after they had been suppressed during intoxication. A hangover is a withdrawal from alcohol which causes the anxiety system to hyper respond.

#### Running Away
Our anxiety systems are very practical. They assume that anything you run away from is dangerous. With the proof being that you ran away.

### Standing Up For Yourself
The ability to respond with aggression decreases rather than decreases the probability that actual aggression will be necessary. If you say no early on in an oppressing interaction and you mean what you say then you limit the scope of oppression.

## Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping
Strengthen the individual. Start with yourself. Take care of yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose you destination and articulate your being.

* > "He wholes life has a why, can bear almost any how." - Nietzsche*

### Chaos and Order
You want to have one foot in that which you have mastered and understood and the other where you are currently exploring and mastering. This is where the terror of existence is under control, this is where meaning is to be found.

## Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you
When you place a delinquent teen amongst comparatively civil peers to reform the delinquent, the delinquency spreads, not the civility.

When you and the people you surround yourself with people who aren't doing shit, you normalize not doing shit with your life and make taking the easy path. You normalize indulgence and sacrificing your future for today.

If you have a friend or friendship you wouldn't recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you let yourself have such a friend. You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It's a good thing, not a selfish thing to choose people who are good for you. If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness.

People who are not aiming up will do the opposite, they will drag you down because your improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.

## Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today

You can either use tyrannical will to force yourself to do things and cause anger and resentment or your can entice yourself into sustainable, productive activity. Do you ask yourself what you want? Do you negotiate fairly with yourself?

Depending on your state of mind you may have to make deals with yourself to get the things you need to get done, done. But if you make a deal with yourself, you better keep it on both sides. You should often ask yourself, what bit of chaos in my life might I eradicate in my office or kitchen that will set the stage for a better play.

### Beliefs
A properly disciplined person is a like a well forged tool. But a well forged tool still needs a purpose. You must have a vision for the future. 

It is impossible to every truly know what you believe, the only way to find out what you actually believe is by watching how you act.

## Rule 5: Do lot let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
A patient adult can always defeat a child.
>*Old age and treachery can always overcome youth and skill.*

Often children will cry out of anger, you can tell the difference between sad crying and anger crying by studying the facial expression. Anger crying is often an act of dominance and should be dealt with as such.

### Operant Conditioning
1. Figure out what you want.
2. Watch the people around you like a hawk.
3. Whenever you see anything a bit more like what you want, swoop in and deliver a reward.

**Example:** You want your reserved daughter to talk more. On morning over breakfast, she shares some anecdote about school. Pay attention. That's the rewards. Stop doing whatever you are doing and listen.

### No 
No only means anything when it means, "If you continue to do that, something you will not like will happen to you." If you allow it to mean nothing, children learn that all adults are ineffectual and weak which is a particularly bad lesson to learn since the child is destined to become and adult. Why would the child want to grow up at all?

## Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
The questions you should be asking yourself are:
* Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you?
* Are you working hard on your career or are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back or drag you down?
* Have you made peace with your brother?
* Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being?
* Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities?
* Have you said what you need to say to your friends and family members?
* Are there things that you know you could do that would make things around you better?

## Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)

Sacrifice will improve the future. So the question becomes, what would be the largest, most effective--most pleasing--of all possible sacrifices? How good might the best possible future be, if the most effective sacrifice could be made? 

What is the highest sacrifice that can be made? something intensely personal and painful to give up.

### On Making Friends
Benjamin Franklin once suggested that newcomers to a new neighborhood should ask new neighbors to do them a favor, on the maxim: *He that has once don you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.*

## Rule 8: Tell the truth--or, at least, don't lie
## Rule 9: Assume the person you are listening to might know something you don't
## Rule 10: Be precise in your speech
## Rule 11: Do not bother your children when they are skateboarding
## Rule 12: Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street
