I started by sketching out the approximate dimensions of the box I wanted. The main features of this cabinet is the slot on the left which is exactly wide enough and deep enough to house two columns of standard PLA boxes. The shelves were intended to hold my school materials.

Once I had the dimensions, I sketched the panels out to scale on a 4x8 foot sheet of plywood so I could plan out my cuts. I went with 3/4" ply wood for this project because I wanted this cabinet to be rock solid.

The last step of the project was staining the cabinet. I used some cherry wood-stain we had laying around and stained the cabinet in two coats.
