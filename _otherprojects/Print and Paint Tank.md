# Print and Paint Tank

My Dad is a big fan of the online game [World of Tanks](https://worldoftanks.com/) so for Christmas I decided to print, paint and assemble a model of one of his favorite tanks in the game, the [E-100](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1644501).

I absolutley maxed out my Ender3's high resolution abiliyties with this print. I printed witha 0.1mm nozzle at a layer height of 0.05mm with all of my other setting optimized for print quality.

Once the parts were printed, It was time to start painting. I assembled the front and back of the hull to paint them together. For the hull assembly and turret, I applied a base coat of dark brown. Once that dried I added painters tape to create the camo pattern. Then I applied a layer or light brown and removed the painters tape to create the camoflage look. I was going for a desert camo.

For the tracks I simply painted them gun metal grey and then spritzed them with some dark brown to give the apprearance of mud on the tracks.
