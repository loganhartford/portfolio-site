# Toonie Dispenser

After moving to Waterloo, I  had to start doing my laundry at a coin laundromat. I don’t like going to the bank that often, so every couple of months I pull out a hundred dollars in toonies. 

This project was created as a better way to store and dispense my laundry toonies.

The plastic weight was printed separately from the rest of the model at 100% infill to make it as heavy as possible. I added after using the dispenser for a while. I found that when the toonies got low, there wasn’t enough weight on the bottom coin to be able to press on it and drag it out without lifting the whole stack and pushing the bottom coin above the slot. Adding the weight makes the dispenser usable down to the last coin.
