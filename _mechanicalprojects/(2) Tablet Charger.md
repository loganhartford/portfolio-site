# Tablet Charger

The goal of this project was to seamlessly integrate a charger for my new tablet into a piece of furniture.

At the back of the model is a hole where the charging cable can be clamped. The large opening at the front of the model chamfers into a tightly dimensioned slot from the top and from the side to ensure the table always properly engages with the charger.

A rectangular cutout just above the charge cable mounting point was added in order to provide some strain relief to the rest of the model. 

Once I decided where I wanted the device to go I cut a hole out of the back of the shelf where I wanted to mount it so I could run the cable out the back and discretely plug it in.

The charger works exceptionally well. I was worried that I would have to fine-tune the placement of the charger after some use to get the alignment dialed in but so far this hasn’t been an issue. 

I was also worried that even with my chamfered entrance, sliding the tablet into the tight cutout would be cumbersome. In reality, using this model is easy and the tablet slides in smooth as butter every time. 

I’m super happy with the outcome of this project.
