# Drive Tower

***
My father runs several servers from his house and instead of buying a big expensive new drive tower, he asked if I could design and 3D print him something that would be a little cheaper and suit his needs.

The cage has two towers, each with 8 drives slots and 3x80mm fans mounts. In between the two drive towers, there is a slot for a standard PC power supply (PSU) to slide into with mounting holes to secure it on the front.

The model on the left is split across the PSU slot into two pieces. This is because the model is too large to print as one piece on my printer. 

In between the towers, where the PSU would sit, youâ€™ll notice some extrusions shaped like half trapezoids. These were added in as spacers to allow the PSU to fit snuggly but also allow its fan to be able to properly bring in air. The loops running up the back of the model are attachment points for zip ties to make cable management easier.

This project took a long time to complete as a consequence of its size.  In addition to the final 80-hour print time to print the two halves, I had to print many tolerance tests in order to make sure everything on the model would be perfect in the final version. I did not want to waste an entire kilogram of PLA printing this monster a second time.
