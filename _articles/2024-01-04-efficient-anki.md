## How to Use Anki: An Efficient Tutorial for Beginners

##### Creating Decks
- Put "life long learning" topics into a single deck.
- Create separate decks for topics that come up in specific retrieval contexts:
  - Exam review
  - Interview prep

#### Organizing Decks
- You can organize decks in two ways:
  - Using the format `MAINDECK::SUBDECK`. For example, "Physics::Thermodynamics."
  - Dragging one deck into another (not recommended unless for very broad subjects).

#### Adding Cards
- Use the keyboard shortcut: A.
- Important fields:
  1. Type
  2. Deck
  3. Front & back fields
  4. Tag field
- Ignore "Fields…" and "Cards…" for now.
- Create cards using `CNTR + ENTER` or `CMD + ENTER`.
- Start with basic card types and expand as needed.
- Use tags instead of sub-decks for card organization:
  - Replace spaces with underscores.
  - Add tags during creation or use the deck browser to add tags to multiple cards at once.

#### Card Structure
- Specific question
- Specific answer
- Screenshot of source
- Tags

#### Studying
- Press the space-bar to show the next card.

#### Card Ratings
- Again: Less than a minute (the card will show up again). Press when you fail to recall the answer.
- Good: Less than 10 minutes. Press when you successfully recall the answer.
- Easy: After 4 days. Use for cards you already knew the answer to or recalled instantly.
  - Shortcut keys: 1, 2, 3
- Pressing "Again" on a mature card 8 times makes the card disappear (ineffective).
- Study every day to prevent card stack-up.
- During custom study sessions, select cards from specific tags.
