#### Effective Learning Techniques

1. **Understand before you learn**
   - Learn before you memorize
   - Understand the concepts and then break them down to be memorized

2. **Build upon the basics**
   - Learning the basics first makes more complicated information easier to assimilate

3. **Stick to the minimum information principle**
   - Make the cards as simple as possible
   - If you keep failing to remember, break down into multiple cards

4. **Cloze deletion is easy and effective**
   - This is where you have a sentence and leave a blank that needs to be filled in
   - Speeds up learning and is effective for learners

5. **Use imagery**
   - Use mnemonic techniques
   - Read about peg lists and mind maps
   - Study books by Tony Buzan

6. **Graphic deletion is as good as cloze deletion**
   - Obstructing parts of a picture is good for learning

7. **Avoid sets**
   - Don't try to learn sets of things

8. **Avoid enumerations**
   - Enumerations are hard to learn

9. **Combat interferences**

10. **Optimize wording**
    - Reduce complex sentences into simple wording

11. **Refer to other memories**

12. **Personalize and provide examples**

13. **Rely on emotional states**
    - You are more easily able to recall information when you are in the same emotional state as when the information was learned

14. **Context cues simplify wording**

15. **Redundancy does not contradict the minimum information principle**
    - Remembering the same thing from different angles is good
