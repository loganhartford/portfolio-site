***
The goal of this project was simple, to create a robot that would allow me to control and shoot an airsoft gun using a RC remote. 

This project proved to be much more difficult than anticipated. This was the first project Iâ€™ve made  that moved and it was my first time working with RC and thus the learning curve was steep to say the least.
